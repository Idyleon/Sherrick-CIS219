# Prints a simple short story about a github repository
print("Once upon a time on github, there was a student dutifully writing away print lines so he can pass his computer class.")
print("The current assignment had him coming up with a short story.")
print("'This isn't coding!' he sneered into his mind's eye as he wrote down a rather uninspired tale.")
print("'And this commentary is way too meta!' he continued, though he quickly shrugged the idea off as he realized he was already at four lines.")
print("'Aaaaaand.... there! With this line I'm currently writing the assignment should be complete!' An overtly smug smile crept across his face as he wrote the insufferably meta line, basking in the success of a job well done.")
